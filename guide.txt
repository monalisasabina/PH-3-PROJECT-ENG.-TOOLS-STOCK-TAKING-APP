Requirements
You need to implement a Python CLI Application that meets the following requirements.

ORM Requirements
The application must include a database created and modified with Python ORM methods that you write.

The data model must include at least 2 model classes.
The data model must include at least 1 one-to-many relationships.
Property methods should be defined to add appropriate constraints to each model class.
Each model class should include ORM methods (create, delete, get all, and find by id at minimum).

CLI Requirements
The CLI must display menus with which a user may interact.
The CLI should use loops as needed to keep the user in the application until they choose to exit.
For EACH class in the data model, the CLI must include options: to create an object, delete an object, display all objects, view related objects, and find an object by attribute.
The CLI should validate user input and object creations/deletions, providing informative errors to the user.
The project code should follow OOP best practices.
Pipfile contains all needed dependencies and no unneeded dependencies.
Imports are used in files only where necessary.
Project folders, files, and modules should be organized and follow appropriate naming conventions.
The project should include a README.md that describes the application.
