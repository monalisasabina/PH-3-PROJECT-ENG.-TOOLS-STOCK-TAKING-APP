# PH3 PROJECT: ENGINEERING TOOLS STOCKTAKING APP


<!-- GUIDE
    
    What Goes into a README?
This README should serve as a template for your own- go through the important files in your project and describe what they do. Each file that you edit (you can ignore your Alembic files) should get at least a paragraph. Each function should get a small blurb.

You should descibe your actual CLI script first, and with a good level of detail. The rest should be ordered by importance to the user. (Probably functions next, then models.)

Screenshots and links to resources that you used throughout are also useful to users and collaborators, but a little more syntactically complicated. Only add these in if you're feeling comfortable with Markdown.
